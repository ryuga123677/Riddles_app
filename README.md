# Riddles_app
Hi I am Harshit, and the idea of making this app was that many people search the riddles on youtube and they have to watch the whole video which consumes their lots of data so I decided to make an app which consumes less data and gives new riddles each time so that people don't get borred with it. In this app data is fetched from a riddle API and storing it into a list, so when the next_riddle button is clicked the content in the list is deleted and new content is added, so each time there will be different riddle.
